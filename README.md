# Apollo Component Library (WIP)

---

## What is it?

Apollo is a component library primarily developed by MileMarker10 to facilitate the Frontend workflow.

## Starting it

When developing components, we always want two things constantly running. The rollup environment and Storybook. In order to have that available to us we will want to

```bash
# To start rollup
$ yarn start
# or
$ npm start

# To start Storybook
$ yarn storybook
# or
$ npm run storybook
```
# mil-59-build-modal-core-component
